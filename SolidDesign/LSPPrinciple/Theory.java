        * Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application’s behavior.

                                                 or
                                              
        * In other words: If class B is a subclass of class A, then anywhere the program expects an A, you should be able to give it a B —
          and the system should still work correctly, without surprises.
