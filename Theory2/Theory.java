// Pillers of OOPs

/*
      1. Encapsulation - Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class.
      2. Abstraction - Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
      3. Inheritance - Mechanism where a new class can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class.
      4. Polymorphism - Ability to present the same interface
