package Theory1;

// LLD - LLD deals with the Structure of the code.
// HLD - HLD deals with the Architecture of the Application.



//  LLD mainly focuses on these 3 aspects : -

/*   1. Scalibility 
         . Handle large number of users
         . Code Structure should allow rapid , low - effort expansion
*/

/*   2. Maintainability 
         . New Fetures shouldn't break existing ones
         . Code Should be easy to debug and locate bugs
*/

/*   3. Reausability 
         . Write loosely coupled , "plug and play" modules    
*/



// What LLD is not ( VS. HLD ) : -

/*   
         1. HLD deals with the Architecture of the Application
         2. Tech Stack - Choosing the right tech stack
         3. Database - SQL vs NoSQL vs Hybrid
         4. Server Scaling & Deployment - Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, etc.
         5. Cost Consideration - Minimizing cloud/server costs
